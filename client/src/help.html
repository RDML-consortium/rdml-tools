    <p style="text-align: justify">
      The RDML-Tools are a software package with everything needed to analyze quantitative PCR (qPCR) data. It can import the raw data 
      exported by the qPCR machines, repair RDML-files, complement missing data, analyze melting and amplification 
      curves, combine several plates, identify reference genes, includes absolute and relative quantification and 
      evaluate experimental groups. By using the RDML-Tools you agree to the 
      <a href="https://www.gear-genomics.com/terms/" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>.       
      RDML-Tools uses <a href="https://rdml.org" target="_blank">Real-time PCR Data Markup Language (RDML)</a>
      to store the data.
      <br />
      <br />
      The RDML-Tools were developped by Andreas Untergasser (Zentrum f&uuml;r Molekulare Biologie, University of Heidelberg, Germany; Genome Core,
      EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany), Maurice van den Hoff and Jan Ruijter (both Department of Medical Biology,
      Amsterdam UMC, location, AMC, Amsterdam).

    <h5 id="Warning">1.2. A Word of Caution</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      LinRegPCR is based on the procedures described in the paper by
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2665230/" target="_blank">Ruijter et al., Nucleic Acids
        Research, 2009 37(6):e45 (doi: 10.1093/nar/gkp045 or PMID: 19237396)</a>. The procedures in this program can
      be used for fluorescence data resulting from monitoring the PCR reaction. You should start your analysis with
      raw fluorescence data. Data import is your own responsibility. It is of importance to check which data are
      exported by your PCR system and how to retrieve the raw fluorescence data. As a quick and easy check; negative
      values should not occur in your raw fluorescent data file. The fact that LinRegPCR reads your data is <b>no
      proof</b> that you have the correct data. By using this program you acknowledge that you have read the above
      paper, understand it, and agree with its conclusions. Therefore, you assume all responsibility and liability

    <h5 id="Data-Standard">1.5. RDML and RDES Data Standard</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      RDML is a structured and universal data standard for exchanging qPCR data and digital PCR (dPCR) data. The data standard
      should contain sufficient information to understand the experimental setup, re-analyse the data and interpret the
      results. It was designed to enable transparent exchange of annotated qPCR data between instrument software and
      third-party data analysis packages, between colleagues and collaborators, and between authors, peer reviewers,
      journals and readers.
      <br />
      <br />
      The <a target="_blank" href="https://rdml.org/">RDML data standard</a> is a compressed
      text file in Extensible Markup Language (XML). By design, it collects the information of different experimenters,
      dyes, samples, targets and thermal cycling conditions separately to experiment/run information, were this
      information is only referenced by the unique ID. In a final RDML file, for example, one target might be
      referenced many times. The RDML-Tools and RDML-Python library were created to handle these dependencies and
      allow modification of an ID without having to update all the occurrences in the experiment.
      <br />
      <br />
      RDML evolved over the years and there are several versions available today. The RDML-Tools can convert between
      the versions. Upload the file to RDML-Edit, activate the edit mode on the main tab and the migration buttons
      become available on the "more" tab. Version 1.0 is automatically converted to version 1.1, the lowest supported
      version by the RDML-Tools. Newer versions offer new and may remove obsolete functionality. Be aware that
      digital PCR is only supported from RDML version 1.3 onwards.
      <br />
      <br />
      RDML was first published in
      "<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19223324" target="_blank">RDML: structured language and
      reporting guidelines for real-time quantitative PCR data in 2009 (Lefever et al., 2009 Nucleic Acids Res.

      <br />
      As an addition, the simple <a target="_blank" href="https://rdml.org/rdes.html">Real-time PCR Data Essential 
      Spreadsheet Format (RDES)</a> was developped as an easy export format. In principle, it is a tab separated 
      text file with essential data and the cycles in columns and the wells in rows. RDES was first published in

    <h5 id="LRP-Library">1.7. The Python Library rdmlpython and the Command Line</h5>
    <p class="regBottom" style="text-align: justify">
      The <a href="https://github.com/RDML-consortium/rdml-tools" target="_blank">RDML-Tools</a> center around the
      <a href="https://github.com/RDML-consortium/rdml-schema" target="_blank">RDML data format</a>. The
      <a href="https://github.com/RDML-consortium/rdml-tools" target="_blank">RDML-Tools</a> mainly provide a web page
      access to the functions of the
      <a href="https://github.com/RDML-consortium/rdmlpython" target="_blank">RDML-Python library</a>, designed to
      create and handle RDML files and their dependencies. The
      <a href="https://github.com/RDML-consortium/rdmlpython" target="_blank">RDML-Python library</a> also offers
      advanced analysis programs like <a href="#RDML-RunAnalysis">RunAnalysis</a> and MeltCurveAnalysis MeltCurveAnalysis
      to analyze the fluorescence data in the RDML files and provide biological or clinical results.
      <br />
      <br />
      Users may choose to install the library as a
      <a href="https://github.com/RDML-consortium/rdmlpython-package" target="_blank">python package</a> calling
      "python -m pip install rdmlpython". All software is GPL licensed except the RDML-Python library being MIT
      licensed.
      <br />
      <br />
      The RDML-Tools are great to analyze single files and view the result. Behind the
      scenes the RDML-Tools do no calculations. They shape the input, hand it over to the server, the server does the
      calculations using the python library rdmlpython, collects the results and hands them to the RDML-Tools which
      display the results and allow to browse them interactively. If big files or a large number of files have to
      be analyzed or due to privacy reasons the data may not run on external servers, running rdmlpython locally
      via the command line interface might be an option. Programmers may use rdmlpython to handle RDML files in
      their own applications.

      of the first experiment. You may select a different experiment with the -e option and a different run with the -r
      option. The option --excludeNoPlateau allows to exclude reactions with no plateau phase from the mean PCR efficiency
      calculation. The option --excludeEfficiency can be "outlier", "mean" or "include". With --excludeEfficiency
      "include" no reaction will be from mean PCR efficiency calculation based on its individual PCR efficiency. With
      --excludeEfficiency "mean" and the optional option --pcrEfficiencyExl 0.05 reactions with an individual PCR
      efficiency outside a 0.05 range from the mean PCR efficiency will be excluded from mean PCR efficiency
      calculation (this was the classic way). With --excludeEfficiency "outlier" only individual PCR efficiency
      outliers based on a Grubbs's test will be excluded from mean PCR efficiency calculation (recommended and the
      default option). The option --saveRaw raw_data.csv creates the table raw_data.csv with the raw fluorescence data.
      The option --saveBaslineCorr baseline_corrected.csv creates the table baseline_corrected.csv with the baseline
      corrected fluorescence data. See <a href="#RDML-RunAnalysis">3. RDML-RunAnalysis</a> for details on those options.

    <h5 id="Tool-Introduction">2.1. Introduction</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      The RDML-Tools cover everything needet to analyze qPCR data. The general concept is to automate as 
      much as possible and archive reliable data independent of user input. To get the most out of RDML-Tools, 
      the user needs to complement a set of data, which will be described in the respective paragaphs below. For 
      example, an increase in fluorescence points to amplification. If the RDML-Tools were provided with the 
      respective sample type, they will be silent if the sample is a positive control or a unknown sample but 
      throw an error if it is a negative control. Naturally, the RDML-Tools will also thow an error if no 
      amplification occures in a positive control.
      <br />
      <br />
      The import of the data and the annotation of the data is cubersome, but usually a lab works with the same 
      machine and a usualy used set of targets. The targets need to be annotated only once and can be copied 
      over from well annotated files.
    </p>

    <h5 id="Import-Introduction">2.2.1. Introduction into Importing Data</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      Although RDML and RDES are around for several decades, not all qPCR machines support one of the formats. 
      Therefore, the import remains a challenge today. In the following section all import options are explained.
    </p>

    <h5 id="Import-validRDMLfile">2.2.2. Import of a Valid RDML File</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      Ideally, a machine exports a valid RDML file, so no big modifications are needed. It is still recomendet 
      to perform some checks before the start. RDML-Tools require the RDML version 1.4, so the file may need to 
      be converted.
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>Open <a href="https://www.rdml-tools.com/edit.html">RDML-Edit</a>, select the RDML file and press 
      "Upload File".</li>
    <li>Go back to the "Main" tab. Check the version in "RDML File Information".</li>
    <li>If the version was not 1.4, click on "Enable Edit Mode" on the top, then the "Migrate to RDML Version ..." 
      buttons appear. Click them one by one inceasing the version of the file to 1.4.</li>
    <li>In the "Links to other RDML tools" section, click on the link to RDML-Validate. It should state that the
      file is valid. Else continue with <a href="#Import-invalidRDMLfile">Import of a invalid RDML file</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Now the file is ready. Do not forget to save it by pressing "Save File".</li>
    </ol>

    <h5 id="Import-invalidRDMLfile">2.2.3. Import of a Invalid RDML File</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      Some qPCR machines do export RDML files, but the files are not valid. For some machines RDML-Tools can 
      fix this errors archiving a valid RDML file.
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>Open <a href="https://www.rdml-tools.com/edit.html">RDML-Edit</a>, select the RDML file and press 
      "Upload File". A error mentioning the invalid RDML file might appear.</li>
    <li>Go back to the "Main" tab and click on "Enable Edit Mode" on the top. Then green buttons appear. Click 
      on "Repair RDML File" and "Recreate Lost IDs".</li>
    <li>Check the version in "RDML File Information". If the version was not 1.4, then click the "Migrate to RDML 
      Version ..." buttons one by one inceasing the version of the file to 1.4.</li>
    <li>In the "Links to other RDML tools" section, click on the link to RDML-Validate. If it does not state 
      "RDML file is valid.", send us the RDML file for further inspection.</li>
    <li>Now the file is ready. Do not forget to save it by pressing "Save File".</li>
    </ol>

    <h5 id="Import-validRDESfile">2.2.4. Import of a Valid RDES File</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      Some machines do export RDES files. In this case RDML-Edit can be used to create an RDML file. Be aware, that 
      amplification data and melting curve data are saved in seperate RDES files.
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>Open <a href="https://www.rdml-tools.com/edit.html">RDML-Edit</a> and press the
      "Create New File" button.</li>
    <li>RDML-Edit switches to the "Experiments" tab. Click on "Create New Experiment".</li>
    <li>Give the experiment a name and press "Save Changes".</li>
    <li>Now the experiment excists and a new run can be created, press "New Run".</li>
    <li>Give the run a name.</li>
    <li>Select the plate format. The pedefined buttons give shortcuts for the most common formats. Do also check
      the "Reaction Volume" fits your experiment in &micro;l.</li>
    <li>Select the respective RDES files for upload at the "Import Amplification RDES" and "Import Melting RDES" 
      fields.</li>
    <li>Press "Save Changes" and evaluate the import message. Check that the "Number of Reactions" field of the 
      experiment fits the expectations and no reactions are lost. If it fails, read the next paragraphs for some 
      tips on how to continue.</li>
    <li>Repeat the steps above if more runs need to be imported.</li>
    <li>Now the file is ready. Do not forget to save it by pressing "Save File".</li>
    </ol>

    <h5 id="Import-RDES-Introduction">2.2.5. Introduction Into RDES</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      If RDES files need to be repaired or CSV files need to be converted, a understanding of the RDES file format is 
      required. It consists of seven columns left of the fluorescence block of which the first six need to be filled.
      The sample type may be one of "unkn", "std", "pos", "nac", "ntc", "nrt" or "ntp". The target type may be "toi" 
      or "ref". Sample and target may be any text, but be aware that technical replicates must have identical sample 
      and target information. Find below an example with amplification data. Melting data will have temperatures 
      instead of cycle in the heading column and colum 7 must be "Tm", but can be empty like the Cq column. Correctly 
      formated RDES files require tab as column separator, linux newlines and dot as decimal separator. See 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://rdml.org/rdes.html">Real-time PCR Data Essential Spreadsheet Format (RDES)</a>

    <h5 id="Import-Raw-Data-Warning">2.2.6. A Note on Raw Data</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      The RDML-Tools may throw a warning if negative fluorescence values are imported or used. Actually, fluorescence 
      values can never be negative, as zero means no light is emitted. Usually negative values occur if a baseline 
      correction was applied to the raw fluorescence data.
      <br /><br />
      Most machines perform a baseline correction based on the first 3(5)-10(15) cycles and fit a linear function, 
      which is subtracted from the raw fluorescence data. If only a constant value was subtracted, the calculations 
      are not affected and the constant value is removed. If the subtracted linear function has also an inclination, 
      RDML-Tools will not be able to calculate the correct PCR efficiencies. There is no way to undo the curve 
      based baseline correction.
      <br /><br />
      If this error occurs, check if the software of the qPCR machine allows to switch off the baseline correction. 
      Contact the vendor and ask for help - and maybe also ask why there is no RDML or RDES export, as this will make 
      life much easier. Up to then, there is nothing you can do about it. You may continue using RDML-Tools, but be 
      warned that the PCR efficiencies might be affected. You may try DNA dilution standards and see if 
      RDML-ExperimentAnalysis reports similar PCR efficiencies calculated by the curves and calculated by dilution.

      RDML-Edit demands correctly formated RDES files, with tab as column separator, linux newlines and dot as 
      decimal separator. Opening the file in Speadsheed programms can easily mess this up and making the import 
      impossible. This can be easily fixed in RDES-TableShaper.

      Some machines do not export RDML or RDES files. In this case the export is more challenging as it has to be taken 
      care that the raw fluorescent measurments of each cycle are exported. RDML-Tools do only read csv formated 
      text files. Most qPCR machines export Excel files. Please convert them by opening in Excel (Microsoft) or Calc

      that the table on the bottom of the "Load" tab breaks up in columns and each column has a number in the 
      grey row on top.</li>
    <li>Go to the "Modify" tab. In the section "Settings to reshape the table" select "Amplification" or

    <li>Select "Replace all commas by dots" if the data use a comma as decimal separator.</li>
    <li>Now the table should appear reshaped in the bottom of this tab. It has numbers for rows and columns with 
      a grey background. This numbers are required to fill the following fields.</li>
    <li>In the "Settings to extract the fluorescence data block" section the fluorescence data have to be selected

      Each field can be modified by a regular expression, if desired. Regular expressions are very powerful but 
      are out of the scope of this manual. If the default (.*) needs to be modified, ask any informatician for 
      help (it will be an easy task) or dive into Javascript capturing regular expressions tutorials.

    <h5 id="RDML-Edit">2.3. Supplement Remaining Data using RDML-Edit</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      If the import as described in <a href="#Import">Import Data into RDML</a> worked out, a vaild RDML file version 
      1.4 should have been created. Although it is valid, some information should be added to get the most of the 
      RDML-Tools. Besides RDML-Edit dedicated tools like RDML-RunEdit, RDML-AnnotationEdit and RDML-Merge help with 
      special functionality. 
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      RDML-Edit is a powerful tool to create, view and edit RDML files. RDML files supports many optional parameters and
      each parameter has many sub-parameters, of which many may not yet be used in the current file. In RDML a target 
      for example is described only once in the targets list with all its futher information and thereafter is only 
      identified by its unique id. In the data elements of each reaction the target is then referenced by its id.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      Be aware that RDML-Edit by default only allows viewing of files. RDML support many optional parameters to
      describe a qPCR or digital PCR reaction. RDML-Edit will hide all parameters which were not entered by the user.
      <b>To modify RDML files you have to enable the edit mode using the button on the "main" tab.</b> Enabling the edit
      mode will switch RDML-Edit into a different mode and enable many buttons and options to modify each element or
      create new ones. RDML does support different versions with different functionality. RDML-Edit can migrate
      between different versions on the "Main" tab if the edit mode is activated. Digital PCR is only supported from
      version 1.3 on. The modified RDML-files must be saved and downloaded on the "Main" tab as they will be lost once 
      the browser is closed.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      Lets assume all samples were labled "sample1" and all targets "target1" and only the fluorescence data of the 
      amplification and the melting curve were imported. Lets repair the run setup and add the rrequired additional 
      information step by step. First the RDML file is loaded and dye information is added:
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>Open <a href="https://www.rdml-tools.com/edit.html">RDML-Edit</a>, select the RDML file and press 
      "Upload File".</li>
    <li>Go to the "Main" tab and check the version in "RDML File Information". If the version was not 1.4, then 
      click the "Migrate to RDML Version ..." buttons one by one inceasing the version of the file to 1.4.</li>
    <li>Click on "Enable Edit Mode" on the top. Then green buttons appear.</li>
    <li>Go to the "Dye" tab and press the "Create New Dye" button.</li>
    <li>Fields with an orange background must be provided with information. Give the dye a ID like "SYBR I" 
      and press "Save Changes".</li>
    <li>The dye "SYBR I" excists now. Press "Edit" to add more information.</li>
    <li>Select the proper "Fluorescence Reporter". This is essential for the calculation of Ncopy. If not provided, 
      "non-saturating DNA binding Dye" will be used by default.</li>
    <li>If a concentration of the dye is known (not of a hybridisation probe, that goes somewhere different), it can 
      be added as well.</li>
    <li>Press "Save Changes" and repeat this for all other dyes.</li>
    </ol>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      RDML is a flexible format. On the "Documentation" tab information text can be stored and attached by its ID at 
      several other positions. For example the freezing of the samples could be described and attached at all the 
      samples which were frozen that way. Similarily, the "Experimenters" or the "Cycling Conditions" can be 
      mentioned and attached to the respective runs. Also this is recommended for documentation purposes, it has no 
      impact on the calculations of the RDML-Tools.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      The target information needs to be added next. The target information are essential for documentation and for 
      reporducibility and are required for the correct calculations of the RDML-Tools:
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>Assuming the RDML file is still opened from the previous step, to the "Targets" tab and press the "Create 
      New Target" button.</li>
    <li>Provide the target with a understandable and unique "ID".</li>
    <li>Select a "Type". Use "toi - target of interest" for all targets that should be quantified. Use "ref - 
      reference target" if this target should be used as a reference gene to correct the gene expression of other 
      genes. If it is not labled here as "ref", it can not be used in the "Quantify" tab or "geNorm" tab of 
      RDML-ExperimentAnalysis later.</li>
    <li>Select the suitable dye used for this target. If the same target is used with different dyes, a second 
      target with a different ID needs to be created.</li>
    <li>Provied the primer sequences and the concentrations of the forward and reverse primer, the hydrolysis probe 
      as "probe1" if present and the amplicon sequence. The amplicon length is essential for the correct calculation 
      of non-saturationg dyes, the primer concentration for probes. Primer concentrations are usually in the range of 
      100-700nMol/l, if not provided, 250nMol/l is used. If the amplicon sequence can not be provided or is not 
      available, provide the length of the amplicon using "Amplicon Seq. Tools". It will create a string of Ns of 
      appropriate length.</li>
    <li>Provide the "Amplicon MeltingTemperature" if DNA binding dyes are used. This should be determined in a pilot 
      experiment for each target. Once provided here, RDML-RunAnalysis can evaluate melting curves for the presence of 
      the expected amplicon and warn if artifacts are detected.</li>
    <li>Press "Save Changes" and repeat this for all other targets.</li>
    </ol>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      The sample information needs to be added next. The sample information are essential for the correct calculations 
      of the RDML-Tools:

    <ol>
    <li>Assuming the RDML file is still opened from the previous step, to the "Samples" tab and press the "Create 
      New Sample" button.</li>
    <li>Provide the target with a understandable and unique "ID".</li>
    <li>Select a "Type". This is essential for RDML-Tools an it will be used to perform validy checks. Positive controls 
      and standards must archive an amplification. Negative controls may not and unknown samples may both. The sample 
      type will result in different, apropriate handling of the sample.</li>
    <li>Select "Double Stranded" yes for plasmids, genomic DNA and PCR products, no for cDNA or other single stranded 
      DNA. This parameter is essential for the correct calculation of Ncopy. Speaking of "one copy", a single copy of 
      double stranded DNA (gnomic DNA) or a single standed DNA (cDNA) could be meant.</li>
    <li>Press "Save Changes".</li>
    <li>If the sample is part of a standard, the sample type "std" should be selected and the concentration should be 
      given by pressing the "Add Quantity" button. Be aware that here the concentration should be given in copies per 
      microliter of the reaction mix in the tube. This is essential if a standard should be used to quantify or a 
      dilution standard should be evaluated in the "Quantify" tab of RDML-ExperimentAnalysis</li>
    <li>Repeat this for all other samples.</li>
    <li>Save the edited RDML file. Go to the "Main" tab and press the "Save File" button.</li>
    </ol>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      Now the dyes, samples and targets are provided, but not used in the runs. Now the experiment ID and the run 
      ID can be adapted in the "Experiments" tab. Check that the correct PCR format was selected and attach the cycling 
      conditions to the respective run. This is advisable for documentation and presentation of the data, but has no

    <h5 id="RDML-RunEdit">2.4. Annotating a Run in RDML-RunEdit</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
     RDML-RunEdit is a tool to view single runs of a RDML files. Once the RDML file was loaded, the desired experiment
     and run have to be selected. RDML-RunView will display the plate setup with the errors and the notes editable. 
     The user can adapt the target, sample and volume information and adapt or delete incorrect errors and notes or 
     introduce errors orrured during qPCR preperation. Emply wells may be deleted.

    <h5 id="RDML-Merge">2.5. Copy Annotation Using RDML-Merge</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      RDML works with elements that refer other elements. For example, the reactions in an experiment refer to samples and 
      targets. The targets refer to an dye. The RDML-Tools require quite extensive annotation as described in 
      <a href="#RDML-Edit">Supplement Remaining Data using RDML-Edit</a>. Usually, the same targets, dyes and cycling 
      protocols are used over and over again. RDML-Merge helps by complementing one RDML file (base) with parts of 
      a second RDML file (add). Once both RDML files were loaded, the desired elements have to be selected. RDML-Merge 
      will display an overview of both files with the contents of the base file on the left and the add file on the 
      right. The user can click on the respective buttons to copy individual or all elements over. This also allows 
      to combine several runs from different files within one experiment.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      If <a href="https://www.rdml-tools.com/merge.html">RDML-Merge</a> merge copies over an experiment, the dependencies 
      will be copied as well. If such a depending element with the same ID is present in the base RDML file and the 
      RDML file to add, the button with (-) will keep the dependencies of the base RDML file while the button with 
      (+) will overwrite the existing elements with the dependencies from the RDML file to add. 
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      The button "Save Base RDML File" on the top left of the "Merge" tab will save the modified file.

    <h5 id="RDML-AnnotationEdit">2.6. Annotate Experiments Using RDML-AnnotationEdit</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      RDML can only handle technical replicates, reactions with the same sample ID and the same target ID are 
      considered technical replicates. All other samples must have unique sample IDs. Experiments require the 
      grouping of samples into different experimental groups or it may be of use to attach further information 
      to individual samples like "sex" or "age". In RDML an annotation element is present, which works with 
      keys and values. RDML-AnnotationEdit modifies this annotation.

    <p style="text-align: justify">
      RDML-RunAnalysis displays and analyzes melting curves, finds peaks and calculates the amplicon melting

    <h5 id="RDML-RunAnalysis-Melting">2.7.1. Melting Curve Analysis with RDML-RunAnalysis</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      Primers might bind additionally to unintended positions in the DNA and amplify additional amplicons, 
      named artifacts. It is not possible to deduce the presence of an artifact product based on the shape of 
      the amplification curve. DNA-binding dyes, like SYBR-Green I and LCGreen bind unspecifically to DNA and 
      do not discriminate between the correct product and artifacts. The artifacts can only be detected by 
      recording a melting curve, where after completion of the amplification cycles the machine gradually heats 
      up the reactions from 60°C to 95°C and records the fluorescence. If the melting temperature (Tm) of the 
      product is reached, the fluorescence drops and the negative first derivative of the melting curve will 
      show a melting peak for each product. The melting temperature depends on amplicon length and sequence, 
      the reaction buffer composition. Therefore, correct products and artifacts can be discriminated based 
      on their melting temperature.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      RDML-RunAnalysis detect the correct products and artifacts automatically on the "MeltingCuveAnalysis" tab,

    <h5 id="RDML-RunAnalysis-Amplification">2.7.2. Amplification Curve Analysis with RDML-RunAnalysis</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      The exponential amplification of an PCR amplicon starts from the beginning of the qPCR run. Due to the 
      minute amounts at start, the fluorescence of the product is below the background noise of the machine and 
      can only be detected when sufficient amounts were amplified to pass background fluorescence. Shortly after 
      the components in the reaction mix, usually the non-saturating dye or the primers get limiting and the 
      exponential phase of the amplification ends. The "AmplificationCurveAnalysis" tab can calculate a TD0, the 
      point when the exponential phase ended, a PCR efficieny per target and the Ncopy value for each reaction.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      The TD0 is calculated as described before for example by Carl T. Wittwer (United States Patent US6303305B1). 
      In principle, the first and second derivative is calculated. To remove measurement noise, the second 
      derivative is smoothed by taking the mean of three adjacent cycles. The TD0 is called on as the zero 
      crossing in the third derivative of the smoothed second derivative. Note that calling of TD0 does not 
      require to define threshold and any baseline correction based on a linear function by the machine will 
      be lost in the second derivative.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      The calculation of the PCR efficiency is based on the inclination of the amplification curve when plotted 
      on a logarithmic fluorescence axis. RDML-RunAnalysis will first perform a baseline correction by 
      determining the exponential range, apply a baseline in the middle between 0 and the lowest 
      fluorescence, split the exponential range by half in a lower and an upper range and calculate their 
      inclinations. If the lower range has a lower inclination than the upper range, the baseline was 
      underestimated. Then a new baseline is applied as half of the value before and the lowest 
      fluorescence of the exponential range. If the inclination of the lower range was higher, the baseline 
      was overestimated and a new baseline is calculated as half of 0 and the value before. This continues 
      untill both inclinations differ less then 0.0001. From the upper inclination the individual PCR 
      efficiency is calculated. The PCR efficiencies have still some noise, so the user can choose to exclude 
      derivating efficiencies based on an statistical function, the difference to the median value or to 
      include all. The statistical function performs an iterative outlier test consisting of a combination of 
      skewness testing and, if a skewed distribution of E values is observed, testing for the presence of an 
      outlying value with a Grubbs test; if present, the outlier is excluded from the analysis and the test is 
      repeated. The remaining values are used to calculate a mean PCR efficiency for the target. Be aware 
      that this calculations do not work on data which were baseline corrected using a linear function with an 
      inclination.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      The TD0 and the PCR efficiency can be used to calculate an Ncopy value, which gives the copies present 
      in the reaction mix in the well.

    <h5 id="RDML-ExperimentAnalysis">2.8. Analyze an Experiment with RDML-ExperimentAnalysis</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      RDML-RunAnalysis calculates an Ncopy, TD0 and PCR efficiency for each reaction of each tecnical replicate. 
      Usually, most experimentes aim at different resuts. The technical replicates should be averaged, corrected 
      with standards and/or reference genes and experimental groups evaluated. RDML-RunAnalysis uses the resuls 
      of RDML-RunAnalysis to perform this calculations. Be aware, that all runs of an experiment have to be 
      analyzed as described in <a href="#RDML-RunAnalysis">Analyze a Run with RDML-RunAnalysis</a> before using 
      RDML-ExperimentAnalysis.
    </p>
 
    <h5 id="RDML-ExperimentAnalysis-InterRunCorr">2.8.1. Inter-Run Correction with RDML-ExperimentAnalysis</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      Ncopy values of different runs can not just be pooled and analyzed, because qPCR results of the same set 
      of reactions on different plates and PCR runs differ by a constant multiplicative factor per plate. A 
      common approach is the use of a calibrator sample, which is placed on all runs and the measured quantity 
      is used as a factor by which the quantities of all other reactions within the same run are divided. This 
      approach has some disadvantages, as the measured quantity of the calibrator is not free of errors and this 
      errors are propagated to all other reactions increasing the technical variation.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      RDML-ExperimentAnalysis uses on its "InterRunCorrection" tab a different approach. The observed Ncopy values 
      for all reactions which overlap between the different plates are used to calibrate the entire experiment. 
      Overlap is defined as biological and technical replicate reactions coming from the same experimental group 
      in which the same target is amplified. The experimental groups can be set as described in 
      <a href="#RDML-AnnotationEdit">Annotate Experiments Using RDML-AnnotationEdit</a>. This approach has the 
      advantage that a large number of different reactions is included in the estimation of the correction factor 
      per plate which leads to cancelling out the technical measurement error in the individual reactions.

    <h5 id="RDML-ExperimentAnalysis-GeNorm">2.8.2. Identifying Reference Genes using geNorm</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      A common approach to reduce variation between different biological samples is to nomalize the measured 
      expression using a validated set of at least two reference genes. Reference genes are target of which the 
      combined expression does not change in the studied experimental conditions. geNorm can be used to identify 
      suitable references genes.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      The implemented geNorm algorithm is a reproduction of its original description (Vandesompele Genome Biol 
      2003) and its implementation in qBase plus (Hellemans et al Genome Biol qBase paper).
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      The validation of reference genes is done in a pilot experiment covering the experimental conditions. 
      Select 10-12 genes of different pathways which could be expected to have a stable expression under the 
      experimental conditions. Of each pathway select only one gene. Take care to have genes of high, medium and 
      low expression in the selected set of candidate reference genes. Make sure that the targets have the target 
      type "ref" as described in <a href="#RDML-Edit">Supplement Remaining Data using RDML-Edit</a>. Run the qPCR 
      and perform amplification curve analysis as described in <a href="#RDML-RunAnalysis">Analyze a Run with 
      RDML-RunAnalysis</a>. Make sure that the sample are annotated in the respective experimental conditions as 
      described in <a href="#RDML-AnnotationEdit">Annotate Experiments Using RDML-AnnotationEdit</a>. Go to the 
      "GeNorm" tab in RDML-ExperimentAnalysis, set the correct sample annotation and run GeNorm. The results are 
      explained on the same tab. The M-value is a measure for the variability of the target and should be below 
      0.5. The V-value is calculated for a combination of targets and should be below 0.15 for the suitable set 
      of reference genes.
    </p>

    <h5 id="RDML-ExperimentAnalysis-quantify">2.8.3. Quantifying Expression with RDML-ExperimentAnalysis</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      On the "Quantify" tab all quantification takes place. It uses the Ncopy values, so for each run in the 
      experiment the amplification curve analysis as described in <a href="#RDML-RunAnalysis">Analyze a Run with 
      RDML-RunAnalysis</a> has to be performed first. If the experiment contains more than one run, the runs have 
      to be combined as decribed in <a href="#RDML-ExperimentAnalysis-InterRunCorr">Inter-Run Correction 
      with RDML-ExperimentAnalysis</a>. Clicking "Run Quantify" will calculate the results wich are persented in 
      sereral tables. The paramters which influence the calculations will be mentioned in the sections below.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      If a dilution standard is present, RDML-ExperimentAnalysis will analyze its properties and calculate in 
      addition to the mean PCR efficiency of the curves a PCR efficiency based on the dilution standard. This 
      calculation requires targets of the type "std" and a given concentration of the standard as described in 
      <a href="#RDML-Edit">Supplement Remaining Data using RDML-Edit</a>. Both PCR efficiency calculations 
      should give comparable results. If one of both is off, it could point to a issue with the raw data and 
      the baseline correction of the machine.  
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      RDML-ExperimentAnalysis will display the results as Ncopy values. If the "Quantification Method" 
      "Reference Sample" was selected, all Ncopy values will be normalized using the standard with the highest 
      concentration. This is aquivalent to the classic absolute quantification method.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      Reactions with the same target and sample name are considered technical replicates. RDML-ExperimentAnalysis 
      handles these technical replicates by calculating the mean, standard deviation and the coefficient of 
      variation (CV) per sample. The results are give in the table "Technical Replicates". This CV provides a 
      quality measure for the differences between the technical replicates. The user is notified when this CV is 
      larger than 0.3, because in that case the technical variation adds more variation to the experiment than is 
      to be expected. The mean of the technical replicates is used for all further analysis.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      In the table "Reference Genes" the relative expression of the reference genes to their geometric mean is 
      calculated. This factor is used to nomalize the Ncopy factors leaving their mean expression unchanged. The 
      reference genes which should be included in this calculation are selected on top with "Selected Reference 
      Genes for Correction", by default all are selected. This analysis requires target genes of the type "ref" 
      as described in <a href="#RDML-Edit">Supplement Remaining Data using RDML-Edit</a>.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      The table "Relative Expression" gives the expression values of the mean of the technical replicates 
      corrected with the correction factor of the selected reference genes. This is aquivalent to the classic 
      relative quantification method.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      If experimental groups were defined as described in <a href="#RDML-AnnotationEdit">Annotate Experiments 
      Using RDML-AnnotationEdit</a>, then "Same Annotation" can be selected in "Overlap" on the "Quantify" tab 
      and the desired annotation selected in "Sel. Annotation". Then the table "Expression by Annotation" will be 
      calculated which combines the samples of the individual groups. Furthermore, the statistics of each 
      replicate will be calculated and given in the table "Statistics".
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      For convenience, a link to RDML-BarGraph will appear. This tool can create create box and whisker graphs 
      and highlights the individual values as dots.

    <h5 id="RDML-TestStat">2.9. Statistics by RDML-TestStat</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify"></p>
     RDML-TestStat calculates basic statistics on groups like the "Quantify" tab of RDML-ExperimentAnalysis does 
     for experiments. It is just a simple wraper for the functions of the <a target="_blank" 
     href="https://scipy.org">SciPy library</a> running on the server. For the parametric tests of two groups, 
     the t-test is used (stats.ttest_ind()). For more than two groups, the One-way ANOVA is used 
     (stats.f_oneway()). For non-parametric tests of two groups, the Mann-Whitney test is used 
     (stats.mannwhitneyu(alternative='two-sided', use_continuity=False, method='asymptotic')). For more than 
     two groups, the Kruskal-Wallis test is used (stats.kruskal()).
    </p>


    <h5 id="RDML-BarGraph">2.10. Visualize results using RDML-BarGraph</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify"></p>
      RDML-BarGraph is a tool to create bar plots with error bars and the individual values as dots. The plot can 
      be downloaded as SVG and mofified in other tools like InkScape. The function to place the dots in a not 
      overlapping form was heavily inspired by the calculateCompactSwarm function from the R package beeswarm
      (see <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/aroneklund/beeswarm">https://github.com/aroneklund/beeswarm</a>).
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify"></p>
      RDML-BarGraph can read CSV files or a table can be copy/pasted form spreadsheet programs into the "Data 
      Points" filed. The table must have individual values as rows and three columns, the experimental group, 
      the target and the value. Then in the "Combine Data" section the median with quartiles or the mean with 
      SEM or SD can be selected. The plot is drawn on the "BarGraph" tab. All parameters like the scaling of 
      the axis can be modified in the sections below. Be reminded that unnecessary elements can be easily 
      deleted opening the final SVG file in Inkscape.

    <h5 id="RDML-Validate">2.11. Validate RDML files with RDML-Validate</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      RDML-Validate validates a RDML file against the corresponding schema. If the validation fails, RDML-Validate
      displays a list of errors. Errors point to programming mistakes in the software used to create the RDML file and
      might be difficult to fix by the user. RDML-Edit might help to repaire files as described in 
      <a href="#Import-invalidRDMLfile">Import of a Invalid RDML File</a>. If this happens, you should contact the 
      developers of the respective software and send us the corrupted RDML file.

    <h5 id="RDML-RunView">2.12. RDML-RunView</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      RDML-RunView is a tool to view single runs stored in a RDML files. Once the RDML file is loaded, the desired experiment
      and run can be selected. RDML-RunView will display the plate setup and, with classic qPCR, the amplification- or
      melt curves. A well / reaction can be selected, which will highlight the corresponding curve. If a curve is
      selected, the corresponding reaction will be highlighted. Melt curves can easily be inspected if the color coding
      is set to target. Setting the color coding to type allows easy inspection of amplification curves.

      The Tools will discriminate between upper- and lower-case characters and handle them as different entries. 
      Technical replicate reactions are identified by having the same sample and target name. The sample type 
      allows the Tools to handle positive and negative controls correctly and the target type is required to 
      identify reference genes.

    <h4 id="RDML-qPCR-Basics">3. qPCR Basics</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      This section explains how to set up a qPCR reaction. Please consider it as one example, the way we do it. It 
      should provide guidance if required, but we do not promote it as the "only correct way". The products used 
      in this section are the ones we use; we do not wish to advice their use above other products. This section 
      would be the answer if you ask A. Untergasser: How would you do qPCR?
    </p>

    <h5 id="BASE-qPCR-Setup">3.1. Setting up a qPCR</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      qPCR requires good primers. Pick required primers using 
      <a href="https://www.primer3plus.com/" target="_blank">Primer3Plus</a> and order them.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      Upon arrival of the primers dissolve them in TE (10mM Tris, 1mM EDTA, pH 8.0) to a stock concentration of 
      100&micro;M (100&micro;mol/L). In 1&micro;l will be 100pmol primer. In the final qPCR reaction, the primers
      are used 1:400 times diluted to a final concentration of 250nM.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      Create a primer premix for the qPCR reaction using 2.5&micro;l forward primer stock solution, 2.5&micro;l 
      reverse primer stock solution and 95&micro;l water (diluting primer 1:40 each). In a 10&micro;l qPCR 
      reaction 1&micro;l of this stock is used (diluting 1:10).
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      A typical qPCR reaction in 10&micro;l could be composed of 1&micro;l cDNA/genomic DNA (maximal 10ng), 
      1&micro;l primer premix, 3&micro;l water and 5&micro;l 2x qPCR mix (LightCycler&reg; 480 SYBR&reg; 
      Green I Master; 04887352001, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany).
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      Some further thoughts: In a 10&micro;l qPCR reaction will be 2.5pmol of each primer (equals 
      1.5*10<sup>12</sup> molecules each). If each primer pair would form an amplicon of 259bp length,
      the weight of the amplicons would be 427ng. In an experiment using FSTL1 279ng could be purified 
      after a regular qPCR reaction. This would suggest that 2 out of 3 primers (66%) formed a amplicon.
    </p>

    <h5 id="BASE-Genomic-Std">3.2. Use genomic DNA as Standard</h5>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      Genomic DNA in combination with a single copy gene can be used as a standard. Use 4ng human genomic DNA 
      (Human Genomic DNA; 11691112001, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) per qPCR reaction containing 
      1200 copies of the genome and amplify the exon 6 of FSTL1 (follistatin like 1) in 6 technical replicates:
    </p>

      ATCACCATTATCAAAGTTCTAGAAAGGGCATGACAAGATCGTTCAGGGATGTTTTGCAGAACCCCTGTTCCATCATTACTCCA
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
      Use RDML-Edit to provide the amplicon sequence in the target information to allow RDML-ExperimentAnalysis to compensate
      for the amplicon length. Without compensation (and in RDML-RunAnalysis) the Ncopy will be 3108 copies instead
      of the expected 1200 copies.
