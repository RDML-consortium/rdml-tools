Version 1.1.0  -  xx.11.2021
----------------------------

- RDML files require the xml data in the file rdml_data.xml.
  As some machines do not follow this requirement, the 
  RDML-Tools can repair missnamed files.

- RDML-Tools record by default an anonymized IP in the log
  files.

- RDML-Tabelshaper may create RDML files with missing  
  information in the columns Well, Sample, Sample Type, 
  Target, Target Type and Dye are skipped with a message. 
  This is intended to be used for empty wells.
